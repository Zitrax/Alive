Currently mail can be sent when we switch state, we should allow for a arbitrary actions or commands to be run at this point. This should be configurable in a config file.

F.ex:

[site.com]
down = no
time = 1296924119
du = action_one()
ud = reboot(123.45.67.89)

Where 'du' are the actions to perform when site goes from down to up.

Actions can be configured in a separate file (actions.cfg):

[reboot_server]
command = ssh %param1% shutdown -r now

where %param1% is the parameter in () in the site configuration.

Preferably the actions could be both an external command or some additional python code.

Update: Triggers has now been added, but in a simple form that allows for a single shell command to be run

* Should allow to configure the email notification in the cfg file
